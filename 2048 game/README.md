# 2048 GAME

Apply MiniMax algorithm to build a tree with depth == 3 and compute expectimax for each node state, 
and return the optimal move for the player. 

Game simulator simulate the game at each one step

can do better with alpha-beta pruning

## Usage
  python3 2048.py


```
 2048.py calls compute_decision() in ai.py to make the best move obtained from the MiniMax tree
 by choosing the best child state action from the root state
```
